# BC Laws API

The purpose of this repo is to collaborate on improvements to the [BC Laws API](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/template/complete/api/index.html).

BC Laws is a portal application that has been developed by the Queen's Printer of British Columbia to access BC provincial legislation. BC Laws is a modern alternative to traditional methods of online publishing which provides feature rich content in a machine consumable format (XML). This information can be accessed and published through our Application Programming Interface (API) which provides access to a significant amount of detailed legislative content. The API content is available through a permissive license which we hope will encourage citizens and companies to create new value added services further enabling citizen legislative access.
